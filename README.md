ADVANTAGES OF GNU IMAGE MANIPULATION (GIMP):
    • GIMP is free, and so are all the updates.
    • It works in a similar way to other commercial image editing programs, and can do most of the same stuff, but at         a cost of zero.
    • Since GIMP is free, you can install it on as many computers as you want.
    • The basic install is smaller than many of it's commercial counterparts. GIMP will run on just about any old              things - even if it is slow. The same is not true of some commercial software.
    • There's a community of GIMP users and enthusiasts to consult if you need help.
